### What is the goal of this project?

The main goal of this project is to collect multilingual text data labelled with respect to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
It is part of a larger initiative within UNDP to create high-quality expert-labelled datasets to develop, improve and test Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. 
**By participating in this project, you are contributing to a safer, more inclusive and equitable adoption of AI technologies both within UNDP and in the world in general.** 

### Who is behind this project?

The project was initiated and is maintained by the SDG Integration team at the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support (BPPS) at UNDP.

### What exactly do I need to do?

You can make your own contribution by **labelling text data with respect to SDGs** in one of the 6 official languages of the United Nations, i.e., Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.
If you are fluent in a language other than English, we strongly encourage you to select that language to contribute.
Contributions in English are always welcome!

### When is the deadline?

The application will initially be open for contributions **until June 30, 2023**.
Make sure to contribute regularly!

### How much time is required to contribute?

You can spend **as little as 10 to 15 minutes** to contribute.
Every single contribution matters.
We strongly **encourage you to contribute regularly** over the course of the project.
Just 10 minutes a day twice a week for 5 weeks adds up to a huge contribution!

### Do I need to label everything at once?

No, this is a continuous exercise.
You can quit and return to the application at any time.
All your contributions will be saved.

### If I quit, will I lose my progress?

No, every single text you label will be saved.
If you return to the application, "Your contribution" counter will reflect the total number of texts you have labelled across all the sessions.
Note that the progress bar reflects your progress in the current session only.

### Are all texts in the application relevant to SDGs?

No, not all text you will see are relevant to SDGs!
We tried to sample texts in a way that maximises the share of relevant texts.
A certain number of texts are irrelevant regardless.
The relevance of each text needs to be carefully considered.
We ask you not to make any assumptions about the number of texts that should or should not have an SDG label but rather consider each text separately.

### The text is not relevant to any SDG. What should I do?

If the text is not relevant to any SDG, make sure you do not select any SDG (all icons are black and white) and just click "Next". Every time you click "Next", your labels are saved. With no labels selected, you're indicating that the text is not relevant!

### The text is relevant to multiple SDGs. What should I do?

If a text is relevant to more than one SDG, make sure to select those SDGs.
Keep in mind that a text may be more relevant to some SDGs than others.
**You should aim to assign only the SDGs that the text is most relevant to.**
**If you are in doubts, we recommend that you err on the side of caution**, i.e., avoid assigning the labels you are not certain about.

### I am not in expert in all SDGs. How am I supposed to label then?

Few of us are!
When you start labelling, you will see "Open SDG Reference" button in the bottom left corner.
You can use it to open a pane that lists all 17 SDGs and their corresponding indicators.
This provides you with an easy-to-use reference to brush up on SDGs.
We encourage you to use this reference pane whenever you are not sure if a text is relevant to a certain SDG.
**A reasonable strategy is then to try to link such a text to at least one indicator description within that SDG.**
**If you find it difficult to do so, you should avoid assigning that SDG to that text.**

### I have a question or suggestion. How can I reach you?

You can reach the developers of the application via email using the feedback button in bottom right corner.
