    You can now see how you and your colleagues are doing by exploring a public leaderboard. By default, all
    entries in the leaderboard are anonymous. If you would like your (and your team's name) to be featured on the
    leaderboard, you can log in to the application and turn on the Leaderboard switch in your profile settings
    in the upper right corner.

    labelling in this language is disabled.

    As we are scaling the application to hundreds of users, we have made changes to make everyone's experience more 
    secure and private. Users can now only access the application with their personal access code. To request your code,
    enter you UNDP email and click on "Get Access Code". The code you receive is like a password. You do not need to
    request it repeatedly, you can reuse it to access the application multiple times. Once you receive the code, we 
    recommend that you save it in your browser or password manager.
